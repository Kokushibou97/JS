Here are some of the most common errors in JavaScript: 
1.ReferenceError:
 A ReferenceError gets thrown when, for example, one tries to use variables that haven't been declared anywhere.
 An example can be, say, attempting to console log a variable that doesn't exist: console.log(username);
Uncaught ReferenceError: username is not defined


2.SyntaxError:
 Any kind of invalid JavaScript code will cause a SyntaxError.
  Example: var a "there's no assignment operator here";
  Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected string
  
  
3.TypeError:
 A TypeError is thrown when, for example, trying to run a method on a non-supported data type.
 A simple example is attempting to run the pop() method on a string:"hello".pop() // Uncaught TypeError: "hello".pop is not a function
 
4.RangeError:
 A RangeError is thrown when we're giving a value to a function, but that value is out of the allowed range of acceptable input values.
 Here's a simple example of converting an everyday Base 10 number (a number of the common decimal system) to a Base 2 number (i.e binary number).
 (10).toString(2); // '1010'
  The value of 2 when passed to the toString() method, is like saying to JavaScript: "convert the value of 10 of the Base 10 number system, to its counter-part in the Base 2 number system".
  JavaScript obliges and "translates" the "regular" number 10 to its binary counter-part.
  (10).toString(8); // 12
  I get back the value 12, which is the plain number 10, writen in Base 8 number system.
  However, if I try to use a non-existing number system, such as an imaginary Base 100, since this number system effectively doesn't exist in JavaScript, I will get the RangeError, because a non-existing Base 100 system is out of range of the number systems that are available to the toString() method:
  Besides using Base 2 number system, I can also use the Base 8, like this:
  (10).toString(100); // Uncaught RangeError: toString() radix argument must be between 2 and 36
  
  
There are some other errors in JavaScript. These other errors include: 
AggregateError 
Error 
InternalError 
URIError
